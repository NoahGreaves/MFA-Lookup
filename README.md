Application is uses Okta for user authentication, cookies for session management, and postgreSQL for backend database management.
The app was built using React.js.

An MFA-Associations Lookup App created for a Bank based out of Alberta, Canada as a Capstone Project.

I was tasked with redesigning and expanding the functionality of an existing web application to
support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) association lookup for retail, business, and wealth
banking channels. The application is a secure authentication and database query platform built
with React, Node.js, and Express. It integrates Okta for user authentication, uses cookies for
session management, and relies on PostgreSQL for backend database operations.

As a challenge to myself, I made it a goal to do a Private Key Code Exchange(PKCE) myself without the assistance of a library.
It was challenging but highly satisfying to complete once I successfully made the exchange. If I were to create another app that 
requires user authentication, I would choose to use a library in the future for development speed and ease of mind.

to run the project locally, navigate to the project folder and run the command 'npm run dev' (for the project I did not make a build 
nor host the application on any servers).
